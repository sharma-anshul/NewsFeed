National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden's new refugee document granted by Russia is seen during a news conference in Moscow on Thursday, August 1. Snowden slipped quietly out of the airport on Thursday after securing temporary asylum in Russia , ending more than a month in limbo.
Sen. Charles Schumer, D-New York, leaves a last-minute news conference at the U.S. Capitol after Russia announced that it would grant Snowden temporary asylum on August 1. "Russia has stabbed us in the back, and each day that Mr. Snowden is allowed to roam free is another twist of the knife," he said.
Snowden's father, Lon Snowden, who has adamantly supported his son, talks to reporters in Washington on Tuesday, July 30. He has urged his son to remain in Russia "until we have assurances that he would receive a fair trial."
Demonstrators in Berlin hold a protest march on Saturday, July 27, in support of Snowden and WikiLeaks document provider Bradley Manning. Both men have been portrayed as traitors and whistle-blowers. Manning was acquitted on July 30 on the most serious charge of aiding the enemy, but he was convicted on several other counts and likely faces a lengthy term in a military prison.
Russian lawyer Anatoly Kucherena, center, speaks with journalists at the Sheremetyevo International Airport in Moscow after meeting with Snowden on Wednesday, July 24. Kucherena said he was in daily contact with Russian authorities about securing permission for Snowden to leave the airport.
Snowden meets with human rights activists and lawyers on July 12 in a transit zone of the Russian airport. It was his first public appearance since he left Hong Kong on June 23. He announced that he was seeking refuge Russia while awaiting safe passage to Latin America, where he has been offered asylum.
Russian President Vladimir Putin attends a meeting in Prokhorovka on July 12. Russian officials said Snowden abandoned his effort to seek asylum in the country after Putin warned that he would have to stop leaking information about U.S. surveillance programs if he wanted to stay.

Leftist Latin American leaders and activists were fuming after some European nations temporarily refused Morales' plane access to their airspace amid suspicions Snowden was aboard.
Bolivian President Evo Morales holds a news conference at the Vienna International Airport on July 3. He angrily denied any wrongdoing after his plane was diverted to Vienna and said that Bolivia is willing to give asylum to Snowden , as "fair protest" after four European countries restricted his plane from flying back from Moscow to La Paz.
Umbrellas with slogans are lined up before a protest march to the U.S. consulate in Hong Kong on June 15. Snowden was hiding in Hong Kong, where he arrived on May 20 before blowing the lid off the NSA surveillance operation.
Protesters in Hong Kong shout slogans in support of Snowden on June 13. The NSA leaker vowed to fight any bid to extradite him from Hong Kong.

Snowden outs himself on June 9 in the British newspaper The Guardian, which published details of his revelations about the NSA electronic surveillance programs. "I have no intention of hiding who I am because I know I have done nothing wrong," he said in a video interview.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Granted temporary asylum, Edward Snowden has few options while in Russia
The federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, specializes in the highest-level national security cases
Snowden could be part of a negotiated deal to send him back to the United States
However, extradition is unlikely in the case of Snowden, who's addmited to leaking intel secrets
Editor's note: With "The Docket," CNN Senior Justice Correspondent Joe Johns, who holds a law degree, will be giving a different take each week on issues in justice, crime and the law.
Washington (CNN) -- Inside a tall, red-brick building in Alexandria, Virginia, there is a federal courtroom just waiting for admitted intelligence leaker Edward Snowden to show up.
But if he ever gets there, and it may be a while, the record of trials in the Eastern District of Virginia suggests justice could be swift and certain.
The modern, high-security facility just south of the nation's capital was the original home of what has come to be known as "the rocket docket" -- a place where many cases proceed at lightning speed relative to legal proceedings elsewhere. High profile national security cases are tried there.
It also is where the government's criminal complaint against Snowden alleging violations of the Espionage Act was filed. There has been no indictment yet.
While Snowden's case is unusual and entangled in secrets that it could drag out for years, the Eastern District undeniably is one of the places that puts a premium on the concept of a "speedy trial."
That's why a guy in Snowden's position -- now a world away in Russia with a grant of temporary asylum -- has to think about his next move.
So what's an NSA leaker to do?
Where is Edward Snowden now?

Snowden's options
Option 1: Find a way to get to a place of relative "long term" refuge. In a major victory, Snowden won temporary political asylum in Russia. "It's a very significant achievement for Snowden. It gives him an entire year for him to figure out his options, to see if he can manage to get to one of the countries that has offered him asylum in South America. It takes him out of the discomfort of the transit zone and into Russia itself, where he presumably has to be with friends and associates and it just gives him a tremendous amount of time," said international extradition lawyer Jacques Semmelman. The down side for Snowden is that his asylum is limited. "It creates the possibility that there has to be something new that will come up in a year," said CNN consultant and former FBI official Tom Fuentes.
Option 2: Negotiate a solution and return to the United States. Edward Snowden's father, Lon Snowden, hoped at first that there might be a way to arrange for his son to return to the United States. But as of last week, he had changed his opinion dramatically after hearing commentary on the issue from Congress and the Obama administration. "In this climate, I don't believe that's possible. So yes, I think Russia is the best place for him. Russia has the strength and conviction to protect my son." But experts don't think the Department of Justice is itching to strike a deal that would clear the way for Snowden's return. "The U.S. will not negotiate with fugitives as a matter of policy," Semmelman said.
Option 3: Extradition. It's the least of Snowden's worries now. The United States has no extradition treaty with Russia. Why? Because certain senators fought it out of fear Russia might ask the United States to hand over Russian dissidents and other defectors. The chances of the United States quickly ratifying an extradition treaty are unlikely.
Option 4: The "no passport" play. This could be a problem for Snowden. When he was indicted, the State Department also revoked his passport. According to Fuentes, international agreements allow governments to deport people without valid passports to the country from which they entered or to the nation of their citizenship. "So in this case, the Russians could at any time -- they could have done it already, they could do it now -- they could stick him back on a nonstop flight to U.S. and say goodbye ... or to Hong Kong where Snowden was last." Hong Kong has an extradition agreement with the United States.
Option 5: Head to a nation's embassy that will keep him. Experts say it is always a possibility to camp at a foreign embassy in Moscow or elsewhere. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is inside the Ecuadorian Embassy in London. And Snowden is traveling with a representative of WikiLeaks. "Once he is in an embassy, in the sovereignty of another country there is nothing the U.S. could do," Semmelman said.
That, say experts, only happens in Hollywood.
